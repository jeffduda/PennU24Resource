# Penn Quantitative Imaging Resource for Pancreatic Cancer

## Mission
Our mission is to facilitate the development of effective therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) via the applications of imaging tools. We strive to develop robust imaging tools in murine models of PDA and translate them to the clinic in settings of co-clinical imaging.

## About The Website
We will be making updates over the course of the U24CA231858 project (9/2018-8/2023). As the project develops, we will share resources and imaging data produced in the project including but not limited to: 

* Imaging tool library - Tools including MRI pulse programs and data analysis software developed.

* SOP library – standardized protocols for generations of orthotopic and xenograft models.

* Data repository – preclinical imaging data and IHC data; clinical imaging data and companion clinical information.

## Publications
The publication below represents the first detailed evaluation of DCE-MRI’s utility for detecting PDA responses to stroma-directed therapy.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffduda/PennU24Resource/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
